# spotify-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project, we will build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Spotify API on AWS. The pipeline will retrieve data from the Spotify API, transform it to a desired format, and load it into an AWS data store.

Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) Spotify data. The pipeline integrates with the Spotify API, utilizes AWS Lambda for data extraction, employs transformation functions, and stores the processed data in Snowflake. The automation of data extraction and loading processes enhances efficiency and enables seamless analytics.

Project Components
1. Spotify API Integration and Data Extraction

Connects to the Spotify API to extract relevant data.
Deploys code on AWS Lambda for efficient and scalable data extraction.
Implements triggers for automatic data extraction at * specified intervals. 2. Data Transformation
Develops transformation functions to process and structure the extracted data.
Builds an automated trigger for seamless execution of transformation processes. 3. Data Storage on S3
Stores processed data on AWS S3, ensuring proper organization and accessibility.
Utilizes S3 buckets for efficient data storage. 4. Loading Data to Snowflake
Creates a Snowflake storage integration for seamless interaction with S3.
Establishes stages and file formats in Snowflake for structured data loading.
Implements the Snowpipe feature to enable automatic data ingestion into Snowflake.
Facilitates analytics by providing a centralized data warehouse in Snowflake.
